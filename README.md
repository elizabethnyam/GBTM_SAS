# adherence-sas-trajectory
Occuring in approxamitely 6-8% of all pregnancies, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are one of the major causes of pregnancy-related maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Still, little is known about the patterns of adherence to chronic hyper- tension during pregnancy, and under what social and demographic conditions usage patterns exist. The objective of this study was to assess adherence to anti-hypertensive medication by pregnant women and to identify the factors associated with adherence or lack thereof. Using a cohort of 28,008 publicly-insured women who initiated anti-hypertensive treatment within the first 20 weeks of gestation, we assessed dosage within biweekly gestational intervals, created group-based trajectory models, and evaluated the association between the different trajectory groups and associated social and demographic determinants. It was concluded the major social determinants of age, race, region, and adequacy of care had a direct correlation on the adherence of anti-hypertensive medications, and consequentially increase dangerous birth risk factors during pregnancy.
